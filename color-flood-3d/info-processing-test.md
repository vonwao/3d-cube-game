# Information Processing System Test

## Implementation Complete ✅

The Information Processing system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Features Implemented:

1. **Logic Gates**:
   - WIRE: Pass signal through
   - AND: Output if all inputs active
   - OR: Output if any input active
   - XOR: Output if odd number of inputs
   - NOT: Invert signal
   - THRESHOLD: Output if inputs > threshold
   - DELAY: Delay signal by 1 generation
   - SOURCE: Signal generator
   - SINK: Signal consumer

2. **Signal Processing**:
   - Signal decay over distance
   - Configurable activation threshold
   - Propagation delay support
   - Visual feedback through color changes

3. **Configuration Options**:
   - Signal Decay: 0-50% per generation
   - Signal Threshold: 10-90% activation level
   - Propagation Delay: 0-5 generations
   - Multiple presets (emptyBoard, fastSignals, noisyCircuit, digitalLogic)

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Added to algorithm selector
   - Sliders for all parameters
   - Preset buttons for quick setup
   - Gate type display grid

### Testing Steps:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5174/
2. Click on "Algorithm: Color Competition"
3. Select "Information Processing" from the list
4. Try different presets:
   - `emptyBoard`: Clean slate for building circuits
   - `fastSignals`: Low decay, fast propagation
   - `noisyCircuit`: High decay, high threshold
   - `digitalLogic`: No decay, perfect digital signals

5. Adjust parameters:
   - Signal Decay: Lower values = signals travel further
   - Signal Threshold: Higher values = gates harder to activate
   - Propagation Delay: Higher values = slower signal spread

### Circuit Building (Future Enhancement):

The system is ready for circuit building features:
- `placeGate()` function for placing specific gate types
- `connectGates()` function for wiring gates together
- `createCircuitPattern()` for predefined circuits (oscillator, adder, counter, memory)

### Visual Behavior:

- Gate colors change based on type and signal strength
- Brighter colors indicate active signals
- Color mapping: Gate type modulo 6 determines base color
- Signal strength affects brightness

## Summary

All three algorithm enhancements have been successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Energy & Resource System
2. ✅ Magnet Automata (Dynamic Flow)
3. ✅ Information Processing

The cellular automata system now supports:
- Resource-based competition with energy diffusion
- Magnetic spin alignment creating flow patterns
- Logic gates and signal processing in 3D space

Each system is fully configurable with presets and real-time parameter adjustment.
