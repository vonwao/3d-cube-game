# Sprint Plan: Color Flood 3D Improvements

## Sprint Goals
1. **Fix Core Functionality Issues**: Resolve keyboard conflicts and improve animations
2. **Enhance Game Transparency**: Add level selection and configurable settings
3. **Improve User Experience**: Better instructions and progressive feedback
4. **Increase Code Quality**: Add comprehensive testing and visual polish

## Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Sprint Week 1)

### 游댮 Task 1: Fix Keyboard Event Conflicts
**Issue**: Arrow keys and color selection (1-6) keys may conflict, rotation controls not working properly

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/engine/useCubeControls.ts`, `src/games/color-flood/ColorFloodGame.tsx`
- **Problem**: Both components use `window.addEventListener('keydown')` which can cause conflicts
- **Solution**: Implement event delegation with proper event.stopPropagation() and priority handling

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Priority order: Color keys (1-6) > Arrow keys > Other keys
// Use event.defaultPrevented to check if already handled
// Add keyboard focus management for proper event routing
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Arrow keys rotate cube smoothly
- [ ] Number keys (1-6) select colors without affecting rotation  
- [ ] Q/E keys roll cube left/right
- [ ] U/R keys undo/reset without conflicts
- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts work simultaneously

**Estimate**: 4 hours

### 游댮 Task 2: Implement Smooth Animation System
**Issue**: Current animation is a simple 200ms setTimeout, not smooth or configurable

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/games/color-flood/logic/simpleGameStore.ts`, `src/engine/CubeMesh.tsx`
- **Problem**: Hard-coded animation timing, no easing, poor visual feedback
- **Solution**: Replace with proper animation system using requestAnimationFrame

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add animation configuration to game store
interface AnimationConfig {
  duration: number;
  easing: 'ease-in-out' | 'ease-out' | 'linear';
  stagger: number; // For animating multiple cells
}

// Use spring physics or easing functions
// Animate scale, position, and color changes
// Add option to disable animations for testing
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Smooth color transitions when flood region expands
- [ ] Configurable animation speed (slow/normal/fast/off)
- [ ] Proper easing curves for natural movement
- [ ] Visual feedback shows flood expansion process clearly
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with 27 cube instances

**Estimate**: 6 hours

### 游댮 Task 3: Create Level Selection UI
**Issue**: Players can't choose starting conditions, stuck with first level

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: New component `src/games/color-flood/ui/LevelSelector.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: `src/games/color-flood/levels/sampleLevels.ts`
- **Solution**: Grid-based level selection with preview and difficulty indicators

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Level selection screen with:
// - Miniature cube preview of each level
// - Difficulty indicators (Tutorial/Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert)
// - Move count and star rating for completed levels
// - Search/filter by difficulty
// - Random level option
```

**UI Design**:
- Grid layout with 3-4 levels per row
- Each level shows: preview cube, move limit, difficulty badge
- Completed levels show star rating achieved
- Hover effects with enlarged preview
- "Play Random" button for variety

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 10 levels visible in grid layout
- [ ] Miniature cube preview renders correctly
- [ ] Click level to start playing immediately
- [ ] Difficulty badges clearly visible
- [ ] Completed levels show star ratings
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

**Estimate**: 8 hours

## Priority 2: User Experience (Sprint Week 2)

### 游리 Task 4: Interactive Instructions with Visual Examples
**Issue**: Text-heavy instructions don't clearly explain flood-fill concept

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/games/color-flood/ui/Instructions.tsx`
- **Solution**: Interactive mini-cube demos embedded in instructions

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add mini-cube components showing:
// 1. What the flood region is (animated highlight)
// 2. How selecting a color expands the region
// 3. Strategic thinking - showing good vs bad moves
// 4. Win condition demonstration
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Interactive 2x2x2 demo cube in instructions
- [ ] Step-by-step flood-fill demonstration
- [ ] Visual comparison of efficient vs inefficient moves
- [ ] "Try it yourself" mini-level embedded in instructions
- [ ] Reduced text, more visual explanation

**Estimate**: 6 hours

### 游리 Task 5: Progressive Level Unlocking System
**Issue**: No sense of progression, all levels immediately available

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/games/color-flood/logic/progressStore.ts` (new), level selector updates
- **Solution**: Unlock levels based on star ratings, save progress locally

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Progress tracking with localStorage
interface GameProgress {
  unlockedLevels: string[];
  levelStats: Record<string, {
    completed: boolean;
    bestStars: number;
    bestMoves: number;
  }>;
}

// Unlock rules:
// - Tutorial always available
// - Easy: Complete tutorial with 1+ stars
// - Medium: Complete 2 easy levels with 2+ stars
// - Hard: Complete 3 medium levels with 2+ stars
// - Expert: Complete 2 hard levels with 3 stars
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Only unlocked levels are playable
- [ ] Clear indication of unlock requirements
- [ ] Progress saved between sessions
- [ ] Achievement system for completing difficulty tiers
- [ ] Option to reset progress for testing

**Estimate**: 5 hours

---

### 游리 Task 6: Visual Feedback for Successful Moves
**Issue**: No immediate feedback when making good strategic moves

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/engine/CubeMesh.tsx`, animation system
- **Solution**: Particle effects, sound feedback, and region growth animation

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add visual feedback for:
// - Successful region expansion (growing highlight)
// - Efficient moves (special particle effect)
// - Near-win state (pulsing animation)
// - Win condition (celebration animation)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear visual feedback when flood region expands
- [ ] Different animations for small vs large expansions
- [ ] Celebration effect on level completion
- [ ] Preview mode showing potential expansion before committing
- [ ] Color-coded feedback for move efficiency

**Estimate**: 4 hours

## Priority 3: Code Quality & Polish (Sprint Week 3)

### 游릭 Task 7: Comprehensive UI/Interaction Testing
**Issue**: Only core game logic tested, no UI or interaction tests

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: New test files for each UI component
- **Solution**: React Testing Library tests for user interactions

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Test coverage for:
// - Level selection and loading
// - Color palette interactions
// - Keyboard shortcuts
// - Game state transitions
// - Animation system
// - Local storage progress
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] >90% test coverage for UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete game flows
- [ ] Keyboard interaction tests
- [ ] Animation system tests
- [ ] Accessibility testing (screen reader, keyboard navigation)

**Estimate**: 8 hours

### 游릭 Task 8: Cube Face Highlighting on Hover
**Issue**: No visual feedback for 3D interaction, hard to understand which cells are clickable

**Technical Details**:
- **Files**: `src/engine/CubeMesh.tsx`
- **Solution**: Raycasting for hover detection, subtle highlighting

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add hover detection using Three.js raycasting
// Highlight hovered cell with subtle glow
// Show preview of potential expansion
// Different highlighting for reachable vs unreachable cells
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Subtle hover effects on individual cube faces
- [ ] Preview showing which cells would be affected by color selection
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during hover interactions
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between interactive and non-interactive elements
- [ ] Hover effects work with both mouse and touch

**Estimate**: 6 hours

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Keyboard Event Conflicts**: Complex interaction between multiple event listeners
- **Animation Performance**: 27 cube instances may impact performance on low-end devices
- **3D Interaction UX**: Mouse/touch controls for 3D rotation can be unintuitive

### Medium Risk
- **Level Balance**: Difficulty curve may need adjustment after user testing
- **Save System**: LocalStorage limitations and data corruption edge cases
- **Mobile Performance**: Touch controls and smaller screens need special attention

### Low Risk
- **Visual Polish**: Hover effects and animations are enhancement, not core functionality
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage will catch regressions
- **Accessibility**: Can be implemented incrementally
