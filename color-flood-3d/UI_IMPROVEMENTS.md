# UI Improvements - Fixed Controls Overflow

## Problem Solved
The controls were being cut off at the top because the container was growing upward from the bottom without a height constraint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Scrollable Controls Container**
- Added `top: 5rem` constraint to prevent overflow above viewport
- Added `max-height: calc(100vh - 7rem)` to limit height
- Enabled `overflow-y: auto` for scrolling
- Custom scrollbar styling for consistency

### 2. **Visual Improvements**
- Algorithm Selector now has a blue border to stand out
- Added "(Settings available)" hint when collapsed
- Auto-expands when algorithm has settings
- Scroll indicators show when content is scrollable

### 3. **How to Use**

#### Finding Algorithm Settings:
1. **Scroll to top** of the left panel
2. **Click** "⚡ Algorithm: [Current]" (first button)
3. **Select** Energy, Magnet, or Info algorithm
4. **Settings appear** with preset buttons and sliders

#### Scrolling:
- Use mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll
- Thin scrollbar appears on hover
- All controls now accessible

## Alternative Layout Ideas

### Option 1: Tabbed Interface (Future Enhancement)
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ [Algorithm] [Patterns]  │ ← Tabs
│ [Controls] [Visual]     │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Tab content here        │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Option 2: Collapsible Sections
- Each section (Algorithm, Patterns, etc.) could collapse
- Save vertical space
- Show only what's needed

### Option 3: Floating Settings Panel
- Algorithm settings in separate floating panel
- Can be moved/minimized
- More screen space for 3D view

## Current Layout Benefits

The scrollable container approach:
- ✅ All controls accessible
- ✅ Maintains visual hierarchy
- ✅ Algorithm settings at top (most important)
- ✅ No major UI restructuring needed
- ✅ Works on all screen sizes

## Quick Test

1. Load the app
2. The left panel should now scroll
3. Algorithm Selector at the very top
4. All sections accessible by scrolling
5. Settings visible when algorithm expanded
